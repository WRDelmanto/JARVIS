# Translations

This folder contains all the translations for Orianna Bot. Simply edit the YAML file and building will take care of the rest. If you are just translating, this is enough.

If you want to statically check if all translations match, you can use the build tool. First run `yarn install` to install all dependencies, then run `yarn build` and it will read the YAML files and confirm that everything matches up.
